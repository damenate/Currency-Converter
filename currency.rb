Currency objects:
Should be created with an amount and a currency code
Should equal another Currency object with the same amount and currency code
Should NOT equal another Currency object with different amount or currency code
Should be able to be added to another Currency object with the same currency code
Should be able to be subtracted by another Currency object with the same currency code
Should raise a DifferentCurrencyCodeError when you try to add or subtract two Currency objects
with different currency codes.
Should be able to be multiplied by a Fixnum or Float and return a Currency object
Currency.new should be able to take one argument with a currency symbol embedded in it,
like "$1.20" or "€ 7.00", and figure out the correct currency code. It can also take two
arguments like before, one being the amount and the other being
the currency code.
